MC920 - Introduction to Digital Image Processing
================================================

Repo for course MC920, with all practical projects developed for the course.

Uses [NumPy](https://numpy.org/), [OpenCV](https://opencv.org/) and [Scikit-Image](https://scikit-image.org/).

The `Images` folder contains inputs for all projects, of different dimensions, extensions and types.

Structure
---------

Every project has:

- Python script with the project implementations.
- Some outputs.
- Report on the project, with result analysis (in Portuguese).

Projects
--------

**Project 0** - Small image-related transformations. Grade: 10/10.

**Project 1** - Halftoning method to transform greyscale images into black and white, preserving most information. Grade: 10/10.

**Project 2** - Analysis of multiple global and local thresholding methods. Grade: 10/10.

**Project 3** - Image segmentation and object analysis, using all available library functions. Grade: 10/10.

**Project 4** - Steganography encoder and decoder to hide messages inside images. Grade: 10/10.

**Project 5** - Principal Component Analysis for compression, using SVD. Grade: 10/10.
